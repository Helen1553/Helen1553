# <i>Hello) I'm Helen</i>✨

### I'm currently at the beginning of my career as a front-end developer. I continue to deepen my knowledge of JS and I'm starting to get a handle on React 😎


🎉 <i>Inspired by clean and understandable code, as well as the feeling of fixing a bug that seemed impossible to solve</i> 🐞

💻 <i>I've been coding for the past 2 years</i>

✈️ <i>Just love traveling and coffee</i> ☕️

😆 <i>Sometimes, I wish there was a "ctrl+z" shortcut in real life (e.g., if your favorite mug broke, you can just press "ctrl+z" to fix it)</i>
